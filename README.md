# Coupon Management API's

I have implemented Cart-Wise, Product-Wise, and Buy-X-Get-Y coupons. You can create, update, retrieve, and delete coupons, as well as apply them to carts with products to determine all applicable coupons.

## API Endpoints
URL : http://localhost:3000/{below_mentioned_routes}

### 2. **Create Coupon**
- **Endpoint:**  `POST /coupons`
- **Description:** Create a new coupon.

#### Example Payload:
```json
{
  "code": "CART10OFF",
  "type": "cart-wise",
  "discountValue": 10.00,
  "minCartValue": 50.00,
  "expirationDate": "2025-02-28T23:59:59Z"
}
```

### 2. **Update Coupon**
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /coupons/{id}`
- **Description:** Update an existing coupon by its ID.

#### Example Payload:
```json
{
  "code": "PRODUCT100OFF",
  "type": "product-wise",
  "discountValue": 25.00,
  "expirationDate": "2025-02-28T23:59:59Z",
  "productIds": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### 3. **Get Coupon by ID**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /coupons/{id}`
- **Description:** Retrieve a coupon by its ID.

### 4. **Delete Coupon**
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /coupons/{id}`
- **Description:** Delete a coupon by its ID.

### 5. **Get Applicable Coupons**
- **Endpoint:** `POST /coupons/applicable`
- **Description:** Retrieve all applicable coupons for a given cart.

#### Example Payload:
```json
{
  "cart": {
    "items": [
      { "product_id": 1, "quantity": 6, "price": 50 },
      { "product_id": 2, "quantity": 3, "price": 30 },
      { "product_id": 3, "quantity": 2, "price": 25 }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example Response:
```json
[
  {"couponId":59,"type":"bxgy","discount":50},
  {"couponId":61,"type":"cart-wise","discount":44},
  {"couponId":60,"type":"product-wise","discount":275,"applicableProductIds":[1,2,3]}
]
```

## Handling Coupon Updates

- When updating a product-wise coupon, the old product associations are deleted first to avoid incorrect mappings.
- For BXGY coupons, any changes to the `buyProducts` or `getProducts` should also be handled by deleting old mappings before adding new ones.

## Example Coupon Scenarios

### 1. **Cart-Wise Coupon Example**
A cart-wise coupon applies when the total value of the cart meets the minimum value (`minCartValue`). For example:

```json
{
  "code": "CART10OFF",
  "type": "cart-wise",
  "discountValue": 10.00,
  "minCartValue": 50.00,
  "expirationDate": "2025-02-28T23:59:59Z"
}
```

### 2. **Product-Wise Coupon Example**
A product-wise coupon applies only to specific products in the cart:

```json
{
  "code": "PRODUCT110OFF",
  "type": "product-wise",
  "discountValue": 15.00,
  "expirationDate": "2025-02-28T23:59:59Z",
  "productIds": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### 3. **Buy-X-Get-Y Coupon Example**
A Buy-X-Get-Y coupon applies when a customer buys a certain quantity of products and gets other products for free:

```json
{
  "code": "BXGY123",
  "type": "bxgy",
  "expirationDate": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "buyProducts": [
    {
      "productId": 1,
      "quantity": 3
    },
    {
      "productId": 2,
      "quantity": 3
    }
  ],
  "getProducts": [
    {
      "productId": 3,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "repetitionLimit": 2
}
```

For every 3 products of X or Y bought, the customer will receive 1 free product Z (up to 2 times).

## Improvements to Consider

### 1. **Flag Instead of Deleting Coupons**
   - Instead of physically deleting coupons, a **soft delete** approach can be implemented by adding a `deleted` flag to the coupon. This way, the coupon is marked as deleted but not physically removed from the database, allowing you to keep track of its history.

### 2. **Track Changes During Updates**
   - When updating a coupon, a flag like `isUpdated` or `isModified` can be used to track whether the coupon has been modified. This ensures we keep a record of what was changed before and after the update, which can be useful for **Analytics** purposes.


### 3. **Caching Coupons in Redis**
   - To improve performance and reduce database load, a **Redis cache** can be introduced to store coupons. By caching coupon data, during read operations, you can minimize repeated database queries and enhance response times. (We can cache during the time of read or write)

   **Example:**
   - Coupons could be cached in Redis with keys like `coupon_{id}` or `all_coupons`.
